**Invisio Bypass Shell** is a next-generation, ultra-stealth PHP webshell (â‰ˆ25KB) designed for advanced command execution bypass and redteam operations.

Unlike classic shells, Invisio leverages a hybrid approach:  
it utilizes alternative PHP functions such as `mail()`, `proc_open()`, `putenv()`, `mb_send_mail()`, and other under-the-radar core features to bypass `disabled_functions` and restrictive server environments.

The shell is engineered to evade detection by leading Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) including LiteSpeed, ModSecurity, Imunify360, BitNinja, Sucuri, WordFence, and more.  
Minimal, obfuscated codebase; no suspicious keywords or comments; full mobile/desktop compatibility.
